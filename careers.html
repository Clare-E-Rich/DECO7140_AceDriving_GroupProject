					<p id="cp3"> <strong>Blair McCarthy – Driving teacher:</strong> I am proof of how Ace Driving School helps people progress in their career. I came into the organization as a admin staff, not really sure what I wanted to do with my career. In my five years working at Ace Driving School I have progressed into teaching more than six hundred people how to drive. To me it’s very rewarding and satisfying. I hope you can join our team soon.</p>

					<p id="cp4"> <strong>Sian Roberts – Kaikōkiri – Careers adviser:</strong>  I didn’t know very much about what our organization did before I applied to join as cleaner at the Brisbane branch. After seven years in that role, I had a career planning session with one of our consultants. They suggested that I apply for a vacancy in Driving tutor, our contact centre, as it would be a good stepping stone in fulfilling my career aspiration of becoming a qualified driving tutor.</p>
