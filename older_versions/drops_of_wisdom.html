					<div id="Widsom: Extend Your Vision" class="floatLeft5">
						<p><strong>Extend your vision:</strong>  One of the most important things you can do to be a safer driver is to look well ahead of you when you’re driving so you can pick up potentially dangerous situations before it’s too late.</p>
						<p>The earlier you spot a potential hazard the more time you will have to take evasive action.  Rather than looking only as far as the vehicle in front of you when driving, you should actually be scanning the road in from to a distance of at least 12 seconds ahead of where your car it – that is, the place you will be after driving for 12 seconds. </p>
						<p>As a rough guide, at 50km/h, 12 seconds is 166 metres or about two city blocks.  This means at 100km/h you should look ahead as far as you can see. </p>

					<div id="Wisdom: Keep Your Eyes Moving" class="floatLeft3">
						<p><strong>Keep your eyes moving:</strong>  Many people only look ahead of them when driving.  This means they’re not getting the full picture of what’s happening on the road. </p>
						<p>As well as looking ahead, you should also use your mirrors to look to the sides and behind often enough to be aware of surrounding traffic.</p>
						<p>Moving your eyes regularly and concentrating on what’s going on around you will also help you stay alert on long journeys. </p>

					<ul>
						<li>Check well a head and behind for any potential hazards.  Don’t look away if you can see potential hazards. </li>
						<li>Remember if you do look away from the road make sure you don’t go off course.</li>
						<li>Never take your eyes off the road for longer than is absolutely necessary.  For example, while driving at 90km/h, if you took your eyes off the road for two seconds you will travel 50 metres. </li>
						<li>Create a cushion of safety ahead of you by maintaining a safe following distance.  Use the two-second rule or the four-second rule when appropriate. </li>
						<li>Create a cushion of safety behind you by maintaining a safe distance between you and any following vehicles.  If a vehicle is following you too closely, slow down, move over and let it pass. </li>
